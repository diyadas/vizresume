# Who Am I?

- a computational biologist studying how stem cells make neurons
<br><br><br>

The features that led to this project:
- a perpetual **project starter**

- a former school newspaper **layout editor**

- a postdoc fellow who has to **write progress reports** for funders

- a job-seeker who has spent too much time **writing a resume**

# The Questions

--
### How do I remember what to put on my resume? 
--

** Google spreadsheet **

--
### How do I prove (fully learn) the skills I list?
--

** Teach a workshop, or do a project **

--
### Where do I put my accomplishments that don't fit in 2 pages?
--

** It's _data viz_ time! **

## What I Wanted to Learn
- Can **ggplot2** truly do it all? (and how to make it do as much as possible)

--

## What I Actually Learned
- <font color="teal">Not everything can be reasonably automated, including my layout opinions.</font>

--

- There are more elegant ways, but my code works.

--

- Everyone has already answered all my questions on StackOverflow but I didn't know my questions until I tried to build it.

--

- <small>It is possible to learn _enough_ [**xaringan**] in a few hours the day before a lightning talk.</small>
